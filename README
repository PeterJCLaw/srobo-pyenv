pyenv
-----

pyenv is an environment within which Student Robotics robot code is
executed.

There are a number of external repositories from which the binaries in
this repository are constructed: 

 * libkoki: https://www.studentrobotics.org/cgit/ckirkham/libkoki.git/
 * firmware blobs: From various SR boards.
 * Other libraries: The libraries in pyenv/lib are mainly from the SR
   openembedded tree.

Patches
-------

This project is managed/maintained by Rob Spanton
<rspanton@zepler.net>, but rather than emailing him, email the Student
Robotics development mailing list <srobo-devel@googlegroups.com>.

Send patches in the following ways:

 * Send an email with the patches attached.  Generate these patches
   with git-format-patch so that they include a commit message,
   committer etc.  Include both "[PATCH]" and "[pyenv]" in the subject
   line of the email. 

 * Send a pull-request email to srobo-devel with "[pyenv]" and
   "[pull-request]" in the subject line along with the *git URL* and
   *branch name* (not some link to a gitorious or github webpage --
   digging around in those websites for the git URLs is time
   consuming and boring).

Things to avoid:

 * Merging in branches from other people, who've already sent their
   patches or pull-request to the maintainer.  *Especially* when
   the patches of the other person are unrelated to your work.   

 * Assuming that your patches will enter into the repository without
   being modified (applies to pull-requests as well as patch sets)
